## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) Java MultiCore Framework

PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. It supports [modular programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) through the use of [Multiton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton) Core actors instead of the [Singletons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) used in the [Standard](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-java-standard-framework/wiki) Version.
